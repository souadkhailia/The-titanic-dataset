### This project involves analyzing the Titanic dataset. The primary goal is to predict survival on the Titanic based on passenger characteristics. For this code, the task is to answer specific questions about the dataset and predict passenger survival based on characteristics like gender, age, and passenger class (pclass). In the dataset, 1 means the passenger survived and 0 means they did not.

## Questions to Answer

**What is the percentage of people who survived?**

**What is the percentage of people who survived?**

**How many of each sex survived?**

**Considering only the group of passengers who paid less than $10, what percentage of this group survived?**

**Overall, what is the average age of those who didn't survive?**

**Overall, what is the average age of those who did survive?**

**What is the average age of those who did and didn't survive grouped by Sex?**
